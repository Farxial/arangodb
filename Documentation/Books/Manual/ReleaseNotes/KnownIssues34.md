| 1 | **Date Added:** 2018-09-05 <br> **Component:** AQL <br> **Deployment Mode:** Cluster <br> **Description:** In a very uncommon edge case there is an issue with an optimization rule in the cluster. If you are running a cluster and use a custom shard key on a collection (default is `_key`) **and** you provide a wrong shard key in a modifying query (`UPDATE`, `REPLACE`, `DELETE`) **and** the wrong shard key is on a different shard than the correct one, a `DOCUMENT NOT FOUND` error is returned instead of a modification (example query: `UPDATE { _key: "123", shardKey: "wrongKey"} WITH { foo: "bar" } IN mycollection`). Note that the modification always happens if the rule is switched off, so the suggested  workaround is to [deactivate the optimizing rule](../../AQL/ExecutionAndPerformance/Optimizer.html#turning-specific-optimizer-rules-off) `restrict-to-single-shard`. <br> **Affect Versions:** 3.4.0-RC.5 <br> **Fixed in Versions:** - <br> **Reference:** [Public Bug Report](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/6399) |
